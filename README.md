Administration Bar Views Grouping
======================

The Administration Bar Views Grouping module modifies the admin bar menus to add a hierarchy to the Views items, grouping Views according to their tags, and thereby shortening the admin/structure/views menu.

You can create and/or modify tags on individual Views (and thereby affect which submenu(s) they appear under) by selecting the "Change view name/description" option on the View's configuration page.
